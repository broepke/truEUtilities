truEInnovations truEUtilities (Version 2.4.5)
For Windows 32 bit operating systems

Installation Instructions:
truEUtilities is packaged in a WinZip self extracting executable. When you finish downloading the file you will want to extract the files into a directory. By default truEUtilities will extract into the temp directory on your C: drive. If you wish to change this you may do so by editing the path. 

Next you will want to run the "setup.exe" that is included in the zip file. truEUtilities will now install very similar to all windows standard programs. 

How truEUtilities works:
1. Purging
truEUtilities follows a few basic rules in order to purge.  Read through these so you have a better understanding of what the software is doing when it purges files:
 - Files must contain a numeric extension as the last extension in order to purge.
 - Files must contain 2 and only 2 "." in the file name - there may be cases where the software can't purge some of the files that it needs to - you will have to do theses manually.
 - Recycling files will greatly increase the amount of time it takes to purge.  This is a function of Windows operating systems.
2. Renaming
 - Only a numeric value may be used as an extension.
 - Stripping extension is not a recommended method of file management.  Try if for your self and see which method best suits your company.
 - NOTE: When stripping the extensions off of files you must use truEUtilities to purge your directories the following times.  Pro/ENGINEER will create a new file with a ".1" extension the next time you save your work and the basic purge program that comes with Pro/ENGINEER will not handle the file that doesn't have a numeric extension.  However, truEUtilities will be able to take care of this issue for you during the renaming process if the "Strip extensions from files" is selected - not with the normal rename.  This is a performance issue.
